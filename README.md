# Aligent Widget Toggle

Adds functionality to the core Magento widgets with a select to enable/disable the widget as well as constrain when they will show either from a date, until a date or between two dates.

No setup is necessary just install the module and the new fields should show when modifying a widget in the Magento admin.
